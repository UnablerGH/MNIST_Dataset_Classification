# MNIST Dataset Classification
This repository contains code and resources for classifying the MNIST dataset using machine learning techniques. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits (0-9) and is widely used as a benchmark in computer vision.

I used Pytorch for creating deep neural network with approximately 97% accuracy
